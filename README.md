🧑‍💻 How to Run (Step-by-Step)

🔹 1. Prerequisites

Java JDK 8 or higher

MySQL Server installed

Eclipse IDE (recommended)

🔹 2. Setup MySQL Database

Open MySQL Workbench or Command Line Interface.

Run the SQL script from sql/library.sql:

CREATE DATABASE library;
USE library;
-- Add tables: books, users, borrowings, etc.
-- Insert sample data

(Optional) Create a database user:

CREATE USER 'lms_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON library.* TO 'lms_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

🔹 3. Configure Database in Java

Update your DBConnection.java inside dao/ folder:

public class DBConnection {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library";
    private static final String USER = "lms_user";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "password";
    // ... Connection logic
}

🔹 4. Add MySQL JDBC Connector

Download mysql-connector-java-X.X.X.jar

Move it to the lib/ folder in your project.

In Eclipse:

Right-click the project > Build Path > Configure Build Path

Click Add External JARs and select the JDBC JAR

Click Apply and Close

🔹 5. Run the Project in Eclipse

Open Eclipse and go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace

Select the root folder of your project

Navigate to main/Main.java

Right-click Main.java > Run As > Java Application

🔹 6. Use the Application

Login using default Admin credentials (if provided in DB)

Use the UI to manage books, users, and borrowing operations

📦 Deployment (Optional - Servlet-based version)

Export the project as a WAR file:

Right-click project > Export > Web > WAR File
